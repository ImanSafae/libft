#LIBFT

Libft is the very first project at school 42. The point is to recreate a library of basic C functions, such as strlen or strcpy, and less basic ones such as split, atoi, itoa, etc. There is one file per function.
A bonus (non-mandatory) part includes functions to manipulate linked lists.

The purpose is to have your very own library, which will be used over the course of the common core journey at school 42, as the use of libc functions (apart from malloc and free) is forbidden throughout most of the following projects.
The libft functions should therefore be easily reusable, and free of potential bugs, crashes or leaks.
